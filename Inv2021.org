**** Introduction

    + This chapter discusses the practice of capitalism in today's world
    + Capitalism affects who we are

**** Capitalism rules okay?

   + Capitalism is not new
   + Capitalism became the dominant system of economic organisation,
     following the cold war.

**** Capitalism: making money

   + Anyone can be rich in a capitalist society
   + Employers always make more money than employees.

**** The secret to making money: minimising and externalising costs

   + Employers seek to reduce wages, employees to raise them
   + People that work for insanely low wages often don't have choice,
     and often believe they are lucky to get a job at all
   + Externalities = costs that can be externalised
   + Companies will always externalise costs when they are cheaper abroad .

**** Capitalism: it's the economy, stupid. But it's culture too!

   + Governments will support capitalism if they see a societal benefit to it
   + Capitalism involves economics and culture through *commodification*
   + Commodification = giving economic value due to cultural value and viceversa
   + Culture is used to sell product, and product to sell culture
   + Capitalism is commodifying culture globally

**** Corporate Capitalism

   + Traces created by corporations don't have limited local affects
   + Recently corporations have become as powerful as countries (maybe even more so)
   + Corporations' interests have been woven into the ideals of the main political
     parties
   + Transnationals often have so much power that they can power through regulations
     in smaller countries.

**** Capitalism: Disneyfying and McDonaldising local cultures?

   + Corporations make place in order to perpetuate their profit-making culture
   + Cultural globalisation is often a a synonym for Americanisation
   + Local cultures tend to resist the dominant power of transnationals.

**** Anti-capitalism: 'another world is possible'

   + Resistance against corporate capitalism has become very common nowadays
   + People fight capitalism

**** Denaturalising capitalism

   + Capitalism's traces have shifted in meaning from 'natural' to 'normal'

**** Anti-capitalism: what does it stand for

   + Against commodification
   + Does not really fit now but aims to change the future

**** The consequences of anti-capitalism

   + Capitalist corporations have reduced the impact of movements through
     'recuperation'
   + Recuperation is a way to neutralise threats by playing them down
     e.g. Making protesting a trend
